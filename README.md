Basic Login System
(Subject to improvements in the future)
This program controls the login algorithm to any arbitrary website account.
The user is first asked if he/she is a New User or if he/she is an already existing user.
The existing users immediately proceed to login with their username and password. The program checks if the username exists in the database(in this case, a dictionary).
If the username exists, the program proceeds to confirm if the user's password is coorect. If correct, the program prompts the user of a successful login.
On the other hand, if a new user wishes to create an account, the program prompts the user for his/her desired username and password. Then, the user is asked to confirm the password.
If the two passwords match, the user is informed of a successful account creation and proceeds to login. If the passwords don't match, the user is asked to try again.
